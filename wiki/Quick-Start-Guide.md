# Quick-Start Guide

## Prerequisites

{: .tip-title }
> New to Linux?
>
> See our [Recommended Distributions](Tips-and-Tricks#recommended-distros) for a list of the distros most compatible with Star Citizen.


{: .tip }
> If using an immutable distro (ie. Bazzite, SteamOS), we recommend the [flatpak installation](Alternative-Installations#flatpak-installation).


1. Install Wine **v9.4** or newer from your distro's repos. If wine is not available from your distro's repos, you may follow the instructions on the [winehq website](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Download).
2. Install winetricks **20250102** or newer from your distro's repos. Links, if needed, are on the winetricks [github](https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks#installing)
3. Select an install location where you have space for the entire game, approximately 110GB
    - Must be a linux-formatted SSD
    - We do not recommend an HDD or NTFS format

## Installation Steps

1. Download our [LUG Helper](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper/releases/latest) (Select the `.tar.gz`. Distro packages are listed [here](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper#installation))
2. [Launch](Tips-and-Tricks#how-to-run-the-lug-helper) the LUG Helper and select `Install Star Citizen`
3. Allow the Preflight Check to fix any issues it finds before proceeding!
4. You may instruct the Helper to install the Wine prefix (this contains the game) to any linux-formatted partition.
5. After the install completes, run the RSI Launcher, log in, and click Install to finish installing the game. **Do not** change the default install location `C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries`!
6. Launch the game. See you in the 'verse!
